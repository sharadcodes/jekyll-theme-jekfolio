I'm a passionate developer and a student, learning to be a giant. I love making projects, having fun and enjoy playing video games.

I am most skilled in ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS and Drinking Cold Coffee. I was selected as one of the student receiving the Google India Challenge Scholarship in the year 2018. I'm currently doing freelancing and side projects in API development using NodeJS & Python.
